# Quick Start

1) **Install Python 3.10+**
2) (Optional) `pip install pygame` if you'll try the 2D prototype later
3) Run the text game:
```bash
python3 bronze_1177bc_v1.2_integrated.py
```

## Tips
- **Early game:** Harvest once, consider Bronze Mine, then Research Imperial Bureaucracy for stability mitigation.
- **Gather Timber** when you need building materials: -8 Grain → +10 Timber.
- **Withdraw** is powerful but risky; use sparingly and only when Stability ≥45.
- Cancelling a menu or being short on resources won't cost you a turn.
- Quit any time with **[0]**.
