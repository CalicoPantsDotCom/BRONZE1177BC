# BRONZE: 1177 BC - v2.0 COMPLETE! 🎉

## What Just Shipped

Complete game redesign based on your feedback. Flask web app now has **v2.0 mechanics**.

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED Features

### 1. **Free Harvest Mechanic**
- Harvest button has yellow "FREE" badge
- Can use unlimited times per turn
- Doesn't advance turn
- Encourages resource gathering before committing to actions

### 2. **Multiple Actions Per Turn**
- Take as many actions as you want
- Harvest 3x, Build 2 buildings, Research tech - all in one turn
- Manual "END TURN" button controls advancement
- No more accidental turn waste

### 3. **Difficulty Levels**
- **Easy:** 30 turns (50% more time)
- **Normal:** 20 turns (original)
- **Hard:** 15 turns (25% less time)
- Selected at game start with big buttons

### 4. **Turn History System**
- **Current Turn Actions Panel** (blue):
  - Shows every action taken this turn
  - Real-time feedback
  - "Click End Turn when ready" reminder
- **Previous Turn Summary Panel** (info blue):
  - Actions taken last turn
  - Random events that occurred
  - Per-turn income (buildings, techs)
  - Drift (Stability -2, Collapse +1, etc.)

### 5. **Critical UX Fix**
Players can now **learn from mistakes**:
```
Turn 5 Summary:
Actions:
- Harvest: +15 Grain, +10 Bronze
- Build Bronze Mine: -15 Grain, -10 Timber | +2 Bronze/turn
- Send Tribute: -15 Grain, -10 Bronze | +5 Prestige, -3 Collapse

Random Events:
⚠️ Drought: -10 Grain, -5 Stability, +2 Collapse

Per-Turn Income:
💰 Bronze Mine: +2 Bronze
💰 Granary: +3 Grain

Drift:
📉 Stability: -2
📉 Collapse: +1
```

**Before v2.0:** "I lost but don't know why"
**After v2.0:** "Ah, the Drought combined with my Tribute spent too much Grain!"
